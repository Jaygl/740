List of things to do

Did the first test not work (where CL.U was empty) because the clutter was too dense and it wasn't finding successors? NOTE: it appears only 6 successors are checked, which means there is small, but reasonable, window for this to not work.

Need to include the start and goal within the environment file.

Seperate displayEnv and displayEnv with the path. This should not be tied together.

Let's try a much larger environment and see what happens? Keep the clutter down to see if it just works at all. Then can amp it up a little...
